# This is a quick setup exercise for CKD and EKS
### Objectives:
1. Using AWS CDK (TypeScript) to deploy an EKS cluster in AWS
2. Deploy an application into the EKS cluster; this part doesn't have to be using CDK(even it's preferred), other method (kubectl, helm etc.) is also fine
### Tasks: 
1. Execute CDK code to spin up the EKS cluster
2. Deploy the application into EKS cluster
3. Destroy the configurations.
